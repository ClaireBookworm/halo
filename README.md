Today, the coronavirus is affect more people than ever before.
Don't believe me? Go to [Predict Covid](predictcovid.com) to be convinced.

One big factor in keeping safe is to have a face mask, to prevent the spread of disease, these masks prevent your bodily fluids from reaching other people.

While many people are staying at home and practicing **social distancing**, many others are unable to not show up. They may be healthcare workers, right at the frontlines protecting us from the disease, or hourly workers working at grocery stores and whatnot to make sure we can all have the resources to stay safe today.
